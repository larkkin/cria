# Dear Parent,

Congratulations on your new bundle of joy! We are so excited to share in the care of your newborn.

Whether you are a first time parent or have several children, newborns can still be scary. We have developed this booklet to help you with common questions and concerns about your baby.

This book will take you through the first year of your baby’s life with what to expect and what to do with common worries. We hope you find it valuable and that it can relieve some of the stress parents have when it comes to newborn care.

Please enjoy the booklet and we look forward to partnering with you in the care of your newborn.

Sincerely,

Amanda Ramey, DO

# GOLDEN HOUR

The hour immediately following delivery. This is a great time to start doing skin to skin with baby. Not only is this an excuse to snuggle, but it provides great benefits for both mom and baby including helping regulate baby’s temperature, stabilize their glucose, and encourage your breast milk to come in. Milk production works on supply and demand, so the earlier baby can start suckling the better it is for your supply. Even if you have had a Cesarean, your partner can do skin to skin with baby.

Babies are typically very alert for 1-2 hours after delivery, so if you are planning on breastfeeding this is a great time to attempt the first latch. Around 24 hours babies start snoozing away and can be sleepy for the next day or so. Even if baby’s latch isn’t successful right away, the more you try the more you encourage “let down” of your milk supply. Our team of doctors, nurses, and lactation consultant can help with getting started. Ask about hand expression and pumping as well!
---
# WHAT'S NEXT

About an hour or so after delivery, nursing staff will officially measure and weigh baby! A physician will also come by to assess your baby and do a thorough physical exam.

# Recommended Medicines at Birth

- Hepatitis B: This is the first dose of a three-shot series (2 months and 6-18 months). If mom has Hepatitis B, baby will receive another medicine called immunoglobulin as well for protection from the virus.
- Vitamin K: This is an injection that prevents abnormal bleeding. Newborns are deficient in this vitamin due to an immature gut system so getting this is very important, especially if you are having a boy and planning to have him circumcised.
- Erythromycin: This is an antibiotic ointment put in baby’s eyes shortly after delivery to prevent bacterial eye infections.

Nursing staff will also perform heart and hearing tests on baby as well as screen for any serious newborn conditions with a small blood sample from baby’s heel. You will also be shown educational videos on newborn care, feeding, etc. Please don’t hesitate to bring any questions you may have regarding these topics up to your nurse or physician before you leave the hospital.
---
# ВREАЅТFEEDІNG

Doctors recommend breastfeeding for one (1) year if possible.

For the first 6 months breast milk is the only food a baby needs, though your doctor will supplement their vitamin D. When breastfeeding you should eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of fluids.

Notify your doctor that you are breastfeeding as some medications are not safe in breastfeeding.
---
# WHY IS BREASTFEEDING BEST?

- It improves our baby’s digestive tract & protects from infections that cause vomiting and diarrhea
- It reduces the long term risk of respiratory infections, wheezing, ear infections, and urinary tract infections
- It reduces the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
- It reduces dental problems, obesity, allergies, and the risk of type 1 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease
- It benefits mom too!
- Reduced blood loss after childbirth
- Reduced risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes
- You burn 300-500 more calories per day breastfeeding
- It is 2-3 times cheaper than formula feeding

# HOW DO I START BREASTFEEDING?

- After birth, we encourage breastfeeding initiation as quickly as possible (within the first hour).
- For the first few days most people only make a small amount of yellow milk called “colostrum."
- Colostrum is rich in nutrients and antibodies to protect your baby.
- Milk production will increase after 2-3 days. The more you feed or pump, the better.
- Your nurses after delivery will show you lots of different ways to hold your baby during a feed.
- Lactation consultants are available after discharge to help you with feeding difficulties.
---
# HOW DO I KNOW MY BABY IS READY TO FEED?

- They wake from sleep.
- They move their head around as if they are looking for the breast or bottle. We call this “rooting.”
- They suck on their hands, lips, or tongue.
- Crying is a late sign of hunger.
- If your baby is crying you may need to comfort them before they are able to feed well.

# HOW TO LATCH YOUR BABY

- You want their mouth to form a seal around the nipple.
- The nipple should be deep and high in their mouth with their top and bottom lips wide open (like a yawn).
- Their upper lip is close to the nipple and lower lip is at the areola.
- Their chin should touch the breast and their cheeks should be full.
- When your baby is feeding well you can usually hear them swallow.
- Hold your baby close, look them in the eye, and speak with a gentle voice during your feeds.

# HOW TO TELL YOUR BABY IS GETTING ENOUGH MILK

Babies feed on different schedules and different amounts of time. Newborns feed 8-12 times a day and should be allowed to finish feeding fully on 1 breast before switching sides.

- By day 4-5 of life babies should have 4-5 wet diapers.
- By day 4 of life babies should have 4+ bowel movements daily.
- Your doctor will weigh your child frequently in the office to monitor their weight as well.
- The length of a feed will vary (usually between 5-20 minutes) and their feeding patterns are irregular.
---
# BREAЅТМILK ЅТОRAGЕ

Breastmilk should only be stored in clean glass or plastic bottles or in bags in small amounts (1-4 oz) and labeled by date pumped.

- Breast milk is safe at room temperature up to 4 hours.
- It is safe in the refrigerator up to 3 days.
- It is safe in the freezer for 12 months.

# PRЕPARING ЅТОRЕD BRЕAЅТМILK

To thaw breastmilk, fill a small container with warm water and put the bottle in it. It is safe for your baby when it is a little warm or at room temperature.

- Do not submerge the container in water as this may allow water to enter the milk.
- Do not heat breast milk in a microwave as this can affect the nutritional and immunologic makeup. Microwaving also heats the milk unevenly, which may burn your baby’s mouth.
---
# BREASTFEEDING TROUBLESHOOTING

# Engorgement

Engorgement occurs when the breasts are too full of milk. Breasts may feel swollen, hard, warm, and painful, and infant may have trouble latching on.

# How do we treat it?

- Breastfeeding will remove milk from the breast and help.
- Hand or breast pump can also be used to let out milk between feeds.
- Using a cold pack or cool cloth on your breasts between feeds.
- Tylenol or ibuprofen can help.

# Sore or painful nipples

It is normal to feel tugging/pulling at nipples with breastfeeding, but not pain or rubbing.

- Make sure your baby latches on the right way. You may need to take the baby off your breast and have them latch again.
- Cool or warm washcloths on the nipples can relieve some pain.
- Tylenol or ibuprofen can help.
- Breast pads between feeds protect the nipples.

# TONGUE TIE

Tongue tie is when a band of tissues connects the underside of the tongue to the floor of the mouth is preventing the tongue from moving freely. Your baby’s tongue should be able to move out past the bottom lip and reach up to the roof of their mouth. It is not known what causes this but tends to run in families at times and is more common in boys than girls. This is generally found if baby has trouble breastfeeding, specifically latching. If left untreated, tongue ties can cause trouble with speech later in life. To treat tongue ties in newborns a physician will cut the frenulum. It is a quick procedure that can be done before you take your baby home or even in the clinic.
---
# Blocked milk ducts

Blocked milk ducts appear as a red and painful lump or white plug on the nipple. Treat by breastfeeding often and ensuring that your baby has a good latch and fully empties the breast.

# Mastitis

Mastitis is an infection of the breast. This usually appears as a fever with a hard, red, swollen area of the breast with muscle aches possible. See your physician as sometimes antibiotics are required. Tylenol or ibuprofen can help.

- You CAN continue breastfeeding. It is also encouraged to use a breast pump to empty the breast fully.

# Yeast Infections

Breastfeeding can cause yeast infections on the nipple. Topical antifungals can be used for this. Make sure to wipe off any excess before feeds and reapply after.

# Poor Production

Breastfeeding or pumping stimulates the breasts to make more milk. You want to make sure your baby is latched on well during feeds to improve this as well.

- Stress can interfere with your milk production, so try to stay calm and relaxed during feeds.

# How do I pump at work?

By law, your work needs to give you breaks so that you can pump. Your work also needs to give you a private place where you can pump.

# How do I stop breastfeeding?

It is great to feed until your baby is about 1 year old. When you stop, drop 1 feeding every 2-5 days or breastfeed for a shorter period each feeding.

# INTAKE BY AGE

Your baby may go through periods where they are hungrier than usual. This is normal during a growth spurt! The better your baby’s intake, the better they will rest between feeds.

- You should not give water to your baby until 12 months of age as it may lower the salt in your baby’s blood.
- After your baby starts eating solid foods their milk intake may reduce to 20-34 ounces a day.

|AGE|RECOMMENDATIONS|
|---|---|
|1 WEEK|Full term babies feed 8-12 times every day during their first week of life.|
|4 WEEKS|By 4 weeks of age babies generally feed 3-4 ounces 7-9 times per day.|
|1 MONTH|Babies are usually full with 24-30 ounces per day (4-8 ounces per feed).|
|4 MONTHS|4-month-olds may go 6-8 hours between feeds at night, but every baby has a different sleep pattern.|
|UNTIL 6 MONTHS|Until 6 months of age breast milk or formula provides all the nutrition your baby needs.|
|12 MONTHS|Other milks are not appropriate until 12 months of age due to the baby's particular nutrient needs.|
|12-24 MONTHS|From 12-24 months your child should drink at least 16 ounces of whole, unflavored cow milk daily.|
---
# ІNТRODUСІNG ЅOLІD FOODЅ

It іѕ rесоmmеndеd tо wаіt untіl 6 mоnthѕ оf аgе tо ѕtаrt ѕоlіd fооdѕ.

- There is a high risk of choking on foods before this age.
- Early food introduction may make their nutrient intake insufficient for their growing size.
- Solid foods too early increases the work of their kidneys.
- Early solid foods increase the risk of obesity.
---
# CHOKING PREVENTION

Do not introduce solid foods until your baby is able to sit with support and has good head and neck control.

- Children under 3-4 years of age should not be given round, hard foods (hot dogs, nuts, grapes, raisins, round candy, popcorn).
- Toddlers should be supervised while eating.
- Children should sit upright during eating, not reclined, walking, running, or riding in a car.

# FOODS TO AVOID

- Children should never be given unpasteurized milk or juice.
- They should never be given raw or partially cooked eggs or foods with raw eggs.
- They should never eat undercooked meat, poultry, fish, or shellfish.
- They should not have honey until after the first birthday due to the life threatening risk of botulism.
- Sweetened drinks have risk for cavities, obesity, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

Remember the feeding habits you teach your baby in the first two years establish lifelong eating patterns.

- You should praise your child for trying new foods.
- Remember, it may take several attempts for your baby to like a new food. Offer a new food 15 times before giving up on that food.
---
# SINGLE INGREDIENT FOODS

Single ingredient foods should be introduced first. Once your child has tolerated each ingredient separately you can give combination foods.

- After starting a new food, do not start another for 5 days to allow time to identify food allergies.
- Adding sugar and salt is discouraged. It doesn’t improve their acceptance of the food and may make them prone to cravings later in life.
- Single grain cereals are a good first food as they supply energy and iron.

# PUREED FOODS

Pureed foods should gradually be added. Pureed meats are high in iron, which is important as your baby grows and are a great first puree. Pureed foods may be refrigerated after opening and are safe for 48 hours.

# INTRODUCING NEW FOODS

You want to introduce a variety of tastes, textures, and food groups by the end of the first year of life.

- High allergy foods (eggs, fish, nuts) may be introduced at 6 months of age.
- By 8-12 months offer fruits and vegetables once a day.
- By 8-10 months your child has the skills to eat finger foods.
- - Consider finely chopped soft foods (fruit, vegetables, cheese, cooked meats, pasta).
- Foods that dissolve easily are great too (crackers, dry cereal).

By 9-12 months your baby may be able to feed themselves or drink from a cup with two hands.

# NORMAL BOWEL MOVEMENTS

How often should a baby’s bowels move? This depends on the age and your baby! Some children have more frequent and some have less frequent bowel movements. This is all normal as long as their bowel movements are soft and easy to pass without pain!

|AGE|RECOMMENDATIONS|
|---|---|
|1ST WEEK|4+ bowel movements a day are typical and are usually soft or liquid. Breastfed infants typically have more bowel movements than formula fed.|
|1-4 MONTHS|Each baby is different with most having 2-3 per day, but some babies may go every week.|
|4 MONTHS & UP|Typically babies have 2 bowel movements per day, but may have more or less.|
|AGE 2|Most children have a bowel movement each day, but can be less frequent.|
|12-24 MONTHS|From 12-24 months your child should drink at least 16 ounces of whole, unflavored cow milk daily.|

# COLOR AND CONSISTENCY

Your baby’s stool color and consistency will change with age. Newborns have soft stool that may be yellow, green, or brown and may appear to contain seeds. Your child’s stool will also vary depending on their diet.
---
# CONSTIPATION

# How do I know if my child is constipated?

- They may have fewer bowel movements than normal.
- Their bowel movements may be hard or bigger than normal.
- They may have pain with their bowel movement.
- They may avoid going to the bathroom or hide when they feel a bowel movement coming.
- They may leak small amounts of stool into their underwear.

# Constipation is most likely to occur at 3 times:

1. Introduction of solid foods or cow’s milk
2. Potty training
3. Entry to school

# HOW CAN YOU HELP YOUR CHILD’S CONSTIPATION?

Under 1 year of age you can help your infant have a bowel movement by gently bending their hips and legs up towards the abdomen to relax their pelvic muscles. You can also exercise their hips (like if they were riding a bike) to help their abdominal muscles contract.

If your child becomes constipated, avoid milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream for a few days.

If constipation is worse when converting to cow’s milk, you may limit to 24 ounces per day as this is sufficient to meet their daily requirements from ages 1-5.

Fiber - For children under 2 our goal is 5 grams per day of fiber. Above age 2 we want them to get their age + 5 grams of fiber daily. Good sources of fiber include pureed vegetables, fruits, fiber containing infant cereal. Examples include pureed peas, prunes, apricots, sweet potatoes, pears, peaches, plums, beans, broccoli, and spinach.

# Water

After the 1st birthday children should receive at least 32 ounces of water daily.

# Juice

Juice can be used as a short trial for constipation. Stop giving your child juice after the constipation has resolved (don’t give for more than 2 weeks).

- Under 4 months of age, mix 1 ounce of prune juice with 1 ounce of water.
- 4-8 months of age, 2-4 ounces of 100% fruit juice per day can be used.
- 8-12 months of age: Up to 6 ounces of fruit juice.

Glycerin suppositories or rectal stimulation can be used for rare, severe episodes.

# For a potty trained child

Encourage them to sit on the toilet for 5-10 minutes after meals.

Some children delay moving their bowels if they are in an unfamiliar environment or if they are busy and ignore the need to use the toilet. It is important to teach your child to let their bowels move when their body says it is time to do so.

# WHEN TO TELL YOUR DOCTOR

# Under 4 months

- Less than 3 bowel movements per week
- Bowel movements are hard (instead of soft and pasty)
- Distended abdomen
- Frequent vomiting

# Any age

- Your child won’t eat due to constipation
- Your child starts losing weight
- You see blood in your child’s bowel movements or diaper
- Constipation is recurrent
- Your child complains of pain with bowel movements
---
# Diarrhea

For babies, diarrhea means that bowel movements are more runny/watery/frequent than normal. For older children, diarrhea is 3+ runny bowel movements per day.

Viral diarrhea can occur year round but is most common in the winter. Usually your child will have a fever over 100.4, watery diarrhea, vomiting, poor appetite, headache, muscle aches, and abdominal cramping. Symptoms usually start 12 hours to 5 days after exposure and last 3 to 7 days. Your child is considered contagious as long as they have diarrhea. These viruses spread from stool to hands and mouth, so washing hands frequently is encouraged.

Many antibiotics can cause diarrhea in children and adults. Typically this diarrhea does not cause weight loss or dehydration and resolves within 1-2 days of completing the antibiotics. Your antibiotic should not be stopped for diarrhea.
---
# WHAT SHOULD MY CHILD EAT AND DRINK WHEN THEY HAVE DIARRHEA?

- Lean meats (chicken, turkey, pork)
- Rice, potatoes, bread
- Yogurt
- Fruits, vegetables
- Milk
- Encourage frequent, small meals to reduce the risk of vomiting
- Oral Rehydration Therapy (Pedialyte, Enfalyte, etc) at a dose of 5 teaspoons per pound

# WHAT TO AVOID WITH DIARRHEA?

- Foods high in sugar and fat
- Gelatin
- Tea, soda, fruit juice, and energy drinks
- Rice water
- Antidiarrheal medicines

# WHEN SHOULD YOUR CHILD SEE THE DOCTOR?

- If their diarrhea is bloody.
- If they won’t eat or drink anything for more than a few hours.
- If they have severe belly pain.
- If they are not acting like themselves.
- If they are not responding to you.
- Intense, repeated episodes of vomiting.
- If they are not producing urine.
- - No wet diapers in 4-6 hours for babies.
- No urination in 6-8 hours for older children.

If they are not producing tears when they cry.

# COMMON NEWBORN RASHES

Rashes in newborns are common and most come and go and are not harmful.

# DIAPER RASH

Diaper rash occurs when the skin in a baby’s diaper gets irritated. This can be due to urine or bowel movements in the diaper, dyes in a diaper that your baby’s skin is allergic to, or irritation from over scrubbing. Each baby has different skin sensitivities, so an irritant for this baby’s skin may have not been a problem with your last child.

A diaper rash may appear as itchy, red, painful skin. It may also appear like raised, peeling skin or as blisters filled with fluid. Yeast infections are due to a fungal infection in the diaper area and cause frequent red areas of skin, sometimes with blisters. These are typically in the skin folds and can radiate outside of the diaper area if not treated early.

# How to treat a diaper rash: The ABCs

- A: Air out the skin by allowing the child to go diaper free
- B: Barrier: use a thick layer of ointment to protect the skin
- C: Clean: Keep the skin clean with warm water on a soft rag
- D: Disposable diapers are better than cloth during an episode of diaper rash
- E: Educate yourself about what triggers seem to make the diaper rash worse for your baby

You should see a doctor if the rash gets worse or fails to improve after 3-5 days of treatment or if your baby develops diarrhea or a fever of 100.4 or more.
---
# Skin Ointments and Diaper Rashes

Skin ointments/pastes can prevent and treat diaper rashes. These should be applied at every diaper change generously. You do NOT have to completely clean off the ointment with each diaper change. Most of these include zinc oxide and petroleum to form a protective barrier between wetness and your baby’s skin. Corn starch powders can also reduce friction and moisture, but are typically not used as your child could accidentally inhale them.

Baby wipes are NOT recommended during a diaper rash if the skin becomes irritated or develops sores as they can be more irritating. During a diaper rash a warm wet rag or a squirt bottle of warm water are recommended to clean your baby. You should also pat them dry instead of wiping as to avoid skin breakdown.
---
# MILIARIA RUBRA (HEAT RASH)

Occurs on covered portions of skin and improves after baby is cooled. Can be prevented by avoiding overheating, removing excess clothing, and keeping baby in air conditioning.

# SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS (CRADLE CAP)

Redness and greasy scales on baby's scalp. It can also affect face, ears, and neck and often spreads to the diaper area. This is usually seen in first month, is self-limited, and is not usually itchy. Typical treatment is to watch and wait. Scales can be removed with a soft brush after shampooing. Scales can also be softened for removal with petroleum jelly or vegetable oil.
---
# A TOPIC DERMATITIS

Red, itchy patches on the skin, commonly known as eczema.

# CUTIS MARMORATA

Mottling of the skin and trunks that improves with warming of baby. It can last weeks to months and sometimes into early childhood.
---
# HARLEQUIN COLOR CHANGE

Redness on one side of a newborn's body when they lay on that side with a blanching of the opposite side that resolves with movement or crying. Most common during the first 2-5 days of life.

# ERYTHEMA TOXICUM NEONATORUM

Most common pustular eruption in newborns. Occurs in 40-70% of infants. Most common in babies born at term and weighing over 2500g. Most often appears on day 2-3 of life. Each pustule is surrounded by blanching erythema. Lesions usually on face, trunk, extremities. No palm or sole involvement. Lesions generally fade in 5-7 days but can recur for several weeks.
---
# ACNE NEONATORUM

Occurs in up to 20% of newborns. Consists of closed comedones on the forehead, nose, and cheeks. Can progress like adult acne into inflammatory papules and pustules. Lesions usually resolve within 4 months without scarring. Treatment is generally not necessary.

# MILIA

Small pearly white or yellow papules that occur in up to 50% of newborns. Most often on forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin but can occur in other places. Usually resolve spontaneously in first month of life.
---
34
---
# Sleep

Newborn babies can sleep 14-17 hours a day! However, babies should be woken up to feed. Babies should always be placed in a crib/bassinet and not in the bed with you. Bed-sharing increases the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome).

# For a Safe Sleep Environment:

- Always place baby on their back to sleep.
- Babies should be placed on a firm, flat surface.
- Do not put anything in the crib/bassinet with baby.
- Dress your baby for room temperature. Don’t over bundle. Don’t cover baby’s head while sleeping.
- Keep your baby away from smoke. Smoking around your baby or having your baby around other smokers increases the risk of SIDS.
- Don’t use products that claim to lower the risk of SIDS. No known product can actually do this.

# CAR SEAT GUIDELINES

Make sure children are properly buckled in a car seat, booster seat, or seat belt—whichever is appropriate for their age, weight, and height.

# REAR-FACING CAR SEAT (BIRTH UNTIL AGES 2-4)

Infants and toddlers should be buckled in a rear-facing car seat with a harness, in the back seat, until they reach the maximum weight or height limit of their car seat. This offers the best possible protection. Check the manual and labels on the car seat for weight and height limits.

- Never place a rear-facing car seat in the front seat. Front passenger air bags can injure or kill young children in a crash.

# FORWARD-FACING CAR SEAT (UNTIL AT LEAST AGE 5)

When children outgrow their rear-facing car seat, they should be buckled in a forward-facing car seat with a harness and a top tether, in the back seat until at least age 5. Children should stay in their forward-facing car seat until they reach the maximum weight or height limit of this seat. Check the manual and labels on the car seat for weight and height limits.

# BOOSTER SEAT

When children outgrow their forward-facing car seat, they should be buckled in a belt-positioning booster seat with a seat belt, in the back seat, until the seat belt fits properly without a booster seat.

# SEAT BELT (TYPICALLY 9-12 YEARS OLD)

Children no longer need a booster seat when the seat belt fits them properly - when the lap belt is across the upper thighs (not the stomach) and the shoulder belt is across the center of the shoulder and chest (not across the neck or face, and not off the shoulder). Keep children properly buckled in the back seat through age 12 for the best possible protection.

*Seat belt fit can vary by vehicle, so check seat belt fit in all vehicles where the child will ride. Sometimes a child might need a booster seat in one vehicle but not in a different vehicle.

# DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES

Developmental milestones are key skills or abilities that 75% of children achieve by a certain age. These milestones include categories including cognition, motor coordination, social interaction, and adaptive.

# VACCINE INFO FOR PARENTS

Immunizations are one of the best ways to protect your family from contagious diseases.

Babies are born with protection against some diseases because their mothers pass antibodies (proteins made by the body to fight disease) to them before birth. Breastfed babies continue to get more antibodies in breast milk. But in both cases, the protection is temporary.

Immunization (vaccination) is a way to create immunity to (protection from) some diseases. Sometimes this is done by using small amounts of a killed or weakened germ that causes the disease. Other times the vaccine is simply a small piece of the germ, such as a protein or a piece of its genetic material.

Germs can be viruses (such as the measles virus) or bacteria (such as pneumococcus). Vaccines stimulate the immune system to react as if there were a real infection. It fends off the "infection" and remembers the germ. Then, it can fight the germ if it enters the body later.

Some parents may hesitate to have their kids vaccinated. They have questions or worry that a child might have a serious reaction or get the illness the vaccine prevents. But the components of vaccines are weakened or killed. In some cases, only parts of the germ are used. So, they're unlikely to cause any serious illness.

Some vaccines may cause mild reactions, such as soreness where the shot was given or a fever. But serious reactions are rare. The risks of vaccinations are small compared with the health risks of the diseases they're intended to prevent.

# DENTAL CARE

Cavities are one of the most common chronic diseases of children in all age groups. Your child should see the dentist around their first birthday.

# What are some risk factors for cavities?

- Breastfeeding or bottle feeding beyond 12 months of age
- Frequent consumption of sugary beverages and snacks
- Prolonged use of a sippy cup throughout the day
- Use of a bottle at bedtime, especially with sweetened beverages
- Use of liquid medications longer than 3 weeks
- Exposure to tobacco smoke
- Juices and sweetened beverages have high cavity potential
- Pure juices should not be offered until 12 months of age and only 4 ounces per day
- Other sweetened beverages (sports drinks, soda pop, flavored milk) shouldn’t be used until age 5
- If you do give these to your child they should rinse their mouth with water immediately or brush their teeth

# TIPS FOR YOUR CHILD'S DENTAL HEALTH

- To reduce the exposure of new teeth to milk/formula, start using a training cup as soon as they are able.
- Bottles should be discontinued as soon as possible after the 1st birthday.
- Sucking on a pacifier or finger is a self-soothing behavior until 18 months, but should be stopped by 24 months.
---
# TEETHING

- It is normal for infants who are teething to be cranky, chew on objects, and drool more than usual
- They may also have fever, diarrhea, or other symptoms
- Chewing on a teething ring or teething toy along with Tylenol can help relieve their symptoms

# ORAL HYGIENE

- Clean your child’s teeth twice daily for 2 minutes with a very small amount of fluoride containing toothpaste
- Your child’s toothbrush size will change by age, so make sure you read the label
- Start flossing when the space between the teeth is too small to clean thoroughly with a toothbrush
- Supervise your child’s dental care until they are 8 years old
- Dental sealants are applied by a dentist to protect the chewing surfaces of your child’s teeth

# FLUORIDE

Fluoride is the primary way we prevent cavities across all age groups. It is important to not use too much fluoride as it can damage dental enamel malformation.

- Infants and toddlers should have a tiny amount of fluoride toothpaste for brushing (the size of a grain of rice)
- At age 3 years you should use a pea sized amount of fluoride containing toothpaste
- To avoid swallowing fluoride, do not give your child water to rinse after brushing
---
# Viral Illnesses

Viral illnesses are common in childhood. Children often get 6-8 per viral illness a year. Most viral illnesses are self-limiting, meaning they will get better on their own. The most common viral illnesses are RSV bronchiolitis, Croup, Covid-19, ear infections, influenza, stomach bug (gastroenteritis). Common symptoms include runny nose, sneezing, congestion, cough, sore throat, fever, ear ache, nausea, and/or vomiting. These illnesses can result in decreased oral intake, sleeping more than usual, and decreased wet diapers.

# How Can You Help?

- Cough – Coughing helps to clear the mucous in the throat, as long as they are breathing okay and still eating and drinking there isn’t much to do. If child is over 1 year old can try warm water and honey. DO NOT GIVE HONEY TO A CHILD UNDER 1 YEAR.
- Sore throat – Same as above with warm water and honey. Can give ibuprofen as described on package. Salt water gargle can help as well.
- Fever – A fever is greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F. Encourage them to drink fluids. Can give Tylenol and Motrin as described on package.
- Ear ache – May pull or rub on ears. Tylenol and ibuprofen as described on packaging.
- Congestion – Saline drops and suction with bulb or Nose Frieda.

# When to Seek Help?

If your child is not tolerating oral intake and has decreased wet diapers or doesn’t pee much throughout the day. If your child is significantly sleepy and difficult to wake up. If they have increased work of breathing with retractions or gasping.

# ALLERGIC REACTION

There is a spectrum of allergic reactions from mild to anaphylaxis. If your child has ongoing allergies, allergy testing by an immunologist is an option and depending on the allergens your child may be appropriate for allergy immunotherapy (allergy shots).

# MILD ALLERGIC REACTION

In a mild reaction your child may have a rash (hives/urticaria), sneezing, runny nose, itching, congestion, or cough.

- Treatment of mild allergic reactions includes Benadryl (oral or topical), allergy medications like Zyrtec or Claritin.

# ANAPHYLAXIS

Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be life threatening. It is most commonly a result of an allergy to foods, insect venom, medications, and latex. Anaphylaxis affects more than one area of the body at a time and can include warmth, flushing, red and itchy rash, shortness of breath, throat tightness, wheezing, abdominal cramps, and vomiting.

- Treatment of anaphylaxis is to seek medical attention immediately and receive epinephrine.

# ТOІLEТ ТRАІNІNG

Pоttу trаіnіng іѕ а bіg соmmіtmеnt! At lеаѕt оnе caregiver nееdѕ tо dеvоtе tіmе аnd еnеrgу tо tоіlеt trаіnіng оn а dаіlу bаѕіѕ fоr 3 mоnthѕ.

You might need to delay potty training if you are preparing for a new child, moving to a new home, returning to work, or if your child is entering daycare. Too many changes at once can make toilet training more difficult and increase the chance of frustration and failure for your child. Remember, toilet training is not a contest! Each child is ready to potty train at a different time. It often takes a child 6 months to learn to stay dry during the daytime and months to years to stay dry overnight.

# WAIТ UNТIL YОUR CHILD ЅHОWЅ ТHЕY ARЕ RЕADY ТО PОТТY ТRAIN (UЅUALLY FRОМ AGЕЅ 24)

- Can they walk to the toilet, help pull their clothes down, and sit upright on the toilet?
- Can they stay dry for several hours or wake up from a nap dry?
- Are they interested in potty training or imitating their parents/older siblings?
- Can they follow simple instructions or communicate their need to go potty?
---
# POTTY POINTERS

- Decide what words you will use to describe toileting and be consistent. Remember, your child will use these words with other adults and children.
- Before you begin, change their diaper frequently so they learn to prefer dry diapers.
- Place their potty somewhere convenient so you can make regular trips to the potty chair.
- The potty should have good foot support with their knees slightly above their hips to allow pelvic muscles to relax for ease of bowel movements.
- Encourage your child to notify you when they need to go and watch for their behaviors to notify you.
- Praise them frequently for using the toilet, even if they don’t go.
- Do not punish, threaten, or speak harshly if they have accidents or won’t use the potty.
- Keep them in loose, easy to remove clothes (and keep an extra set with you in case there are accidents).
- Remind them to use the toilet after waking and throughout the day.
- If your child is not making progress stop potty training for 2-3 months.
- Monitor closely for signs of constipation.
- If your child struggles with constipation this must be improved before attempting to potty train.
- If your child develops constipation while potty training, stop toilet training temporarily.
- Make sure your child is getting plenty of fiber and water at this time.
