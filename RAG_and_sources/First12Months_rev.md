# Comments:

- Breast milk or formula is all your baby needs for the first 6 months.
- Your baby may be ready for cereal when he/she can sit up with good head control.
- Cereal should be mixed thinly at first. Do not put cereal in your baby’s bottle unless instructed by a doctor.
- Never microwave bottles or food for your baby - it may not heat evenly and may burn your baby’s mouth. Always test the temperature before feeding your baby.
- Do not add sugar or salt to your baby’s food.
- Most babies are ready to try a cup now.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that solids foods may be introduced between 4-6 months of age.

# Comments:

- Do not allow baby to fall asleep with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay.
- It is now okay to give your baby some fluoridated water, about 2–4 ounces twice a day. (Check with your city to determine if your water is fluoridated)
- Always give juice in a sippy cup, not in a bottle. No juice before 6 months of age. Juice should be 100% fruit juice and must be pasteurized.

# NEVER give honey or foods made with honey to your baby during the first 12 months.

Honey may contain toxins that are poisonous to babies.

# Choking Hazards

Do not give these foods to your baby!

- Hot dogs, nuts, seeds, popcorn, chips, grapes, raisins, raw vegetables, hard & chewy candy, French fries, tough meats, dried fruit, and sticky foods such as peanut butter.

Always supervise your child during meals and feed in a seated position.

# Common Food Allergies

Egg whites, milk, seafood, peanuts, tree nuts (almonds, pecans, walnuts, etc), wheat, and soy products.

Introduce one new food at a time and wait 3-4 days before trying another new food. This makes it easier to see if your baby is allergic to a certain food.
