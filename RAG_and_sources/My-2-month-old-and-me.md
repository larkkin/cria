# Recommendations from your pediatrician

You and your baby have now settled into a routine as she continues to learn to interact with you and her environment: By two months you are now getting used to this new member of your family: She has started to smile at your face and the sound of your voice: This reward of your child's smile is the beginning of many more joyful moments to come:

# Feeding

At this time your baby should only be feeding breast milk or formula with 6-8 feeds a day: She DOES NOT need water or to be introduced to other foods or cereals yet. A typical schedule may be the following:

|Time|Activity|
|---|---|
|6:30-7:00|Wake-up and Eat 4-6oz bottle or 20 minutes of breastfeeding|
|7:00-8:00|Playtime|
|8:00-10:00|Morning nap|
|10:00|Feeding time 4-6 oz bottle or 20 minutes of breastfeeding|
|10:30-11:30|Playtime|
|11:30-1:00|Mid afternoon nap|
|1:00|Feeding time 4-6 oz bottle or 20 minutes of breastfeeding|
|1:30-2:30|Playtime|
|4:00|Feeding time: 4-6 oz bottle or 20 minutes of breastfeeding|
|2:30-4:00|Naptime|
|4:30-5:00|Playtime|
|5:00-6:00|Take baby for stroll outside|
|6:00|Bath time (never leave baby alone in bathtub)|
|7:00|Feeding time 4-6 oz bottle or 20 minutes of breastfeeding|
|6:30|Read a book to baby|
|7:30|Bedtime|
|10:30|Nighttime Dream Feed 4-6 oz bottle or 20 minutes of breastfeeding|
|1:00-2:00|Baby may awaken to feed again|

Don't worry if your baby does not follow this schedule exactly as this is just a guide. Continue to feed your baby on demand but try to space the feeds to every 3 hours during the day: Many babies "spit-up" after feeds. This is normal for some babies but if your baby is spitting up after every feed; crying and arching her back this could be a sign of GERD or the gastroesophageal reflux. The first step is to make sure your baby burps well half way.

# Development

# Playtime

Keep your baby upright for 30-45 minutes after feeds. If your baby continues to spit up your doctor may prescribe a medicine.

Do not feel that you have to keep your home completely quiet for your baby: Talk and sing to your baby to stimulate her verbal development. Provide some time with objects of varying shapes and textures. Her vision is much better now than immediately after birth and she will enjoy looking and studying your face.

# Social Smile

By two months your baby will smile at the sight of your face or the sound of your voice.

# Cooing

Your baby will start to make vowel sounds "ahh-goo" as a form of communication: She will talk with you in her own language.

# Tracking Objects

She will eventually be able to follow an object in a circular pattern too.

Your baby will follow our movements around the room.

# Improved Head Control

When on her belly, your baby may raise her head off the ground for a few seconds: It is important to place her on her tummy for TUMMY TIME twice a day for 5-10 minutes so she can develop a stronger neck and back muscles. Do not leave her on her tummy unsupervised, as she does not have good enough head control to always clear her airway.

# Improved Fine Motor Skills

Your baby will open and close her hands. She will not hold them tightly shut as when she was first born. She will start to grasp objects such as rattles in her hands and drop them shortly after. Make sure to cut her nails weekly and do not place mittens on her hands, as she needs her hands free to explore her new world.

# Developing Social Skills

Activities to continue: Smile and talk to your baby often. Rock; cuddle; and sing songs to your baby: Soothe and calm your baby when fussy and respond promptly to cries. Prop your baby up to see what goes on around them.

Being massaged: To relax your baby, gently stroke their back, arms, or legs from top to bottom.

# Being bathed

Run a shallow bath of warm water: Hold your baby securely and let them splash, kick, and enjoy:

# Looking in mirrors

Show your baby how they look in a mirror.

# Sleeping

As you can see in the schedule above your baby will still take several naps a day: It is good to have routine for when she wakes up and when she is put down to bed at night time. She is probably not going to sleep through the night a consecutive 8-10 hours until she is closer to 4 months old. Start good sleep hygiene by developing a bedtime routine, which may include giving her a bath, reading a book; singing a nighttime song or prayer: Rock your baby to help her calm down. If feeding close to bedtime, do not let her fall asleep: It is best to put her down drowsy and not completely asleep. This way she can learn to fall asleep on her own and can soothe herself to sleep when she awakens in the middle of the night.

It is also a good idea to put her in her own crib for naps too. If she is not sleeping in her own crib; this is a good time to transition to one. You can keep the crib in your room for a few months to help with nighttime feeds. Always lay her on her back to sleep. This reduces the risk of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome): Keep blankets, pillows and other objects out of her crib. These are potential suffocation hazards.

# Returning to Work

If you are taking maternity leave, you may be returning to work within the next month: This may be hard to think about: If you have not decided whom you are going to leave your baby with make sure you start to research your options now: If you are taking your baby to a daycare try to have as small as possible adult to baby ratio (1:3). If you are hiring a caregiver make sure you have recommendations, and you observe her interact with your baby: It is a good idea to have her come to the house a week or two before you return to work so you can show her your baby's routine. Take short trips to the grocery store or to run other errands during the day: This will also make you feel more comfortable leaving your baby with her on your first day back to work; If you are breastfeeding; arrange time to pump during the day: If it is possible, try to return home at lunchtime to breastfeed your baby: It may appear time consuming at first but pumping will become part of your regular schedule.

It is a normal feeling to be sad on your first day of work. Some mothers also feel relieved to return to their regular daytime schedules: Don't feel guilty. Your baby will remember you and always greet you with a smile when you return.

# Time for Parents

It is important now that your baby is a little older for mom and dad to take time for themselves. Try to go out on a "date" at least once every two weeks. Get a babysitter you trust to watch your baby for a few hours so the two of you can have alone time. It is important that you still talk with each other about all the day-to-day things other than the baby:

# Safety Tips

1. Always put your baby in an infant carrier/car seat while traveling in the car: The safest place for the baby is in the back middle seat. The car seat should be rear facing until closer to one year of age.
2. DO NOT leave your baby unattended on the changing table, in the bathtub, couch, bed; or chair: Even though your baby cannot roll over she may extend her body and fall off.
3. Use caution when holding your baby and drinking hot liquids. Your baby's skin can burn in one second at 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
4. Never shake a baby.
5. Be careful of any jewelry you put on your baby: Small beads can fall off and be potential choking hazards.
6. Never leave your baby alone with pets around: They may unintentionally hurt your baby.
7. DO NOT smoke around your baby or allow smoke in the home: Exposure to smoke increases the chances of ear infections and SIDS.
