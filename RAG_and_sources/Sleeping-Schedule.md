# 1 Sleeping Schedules

For newborns, use the Expected Delivery Date of your baby. If your baby is 3 weeks premature, then at 7 weeks old they are considered 1 month old for the purpose of sleeping schedules.

The following information is a guideline only. Babies will vary and you should always use your best judgement when determining the appropriate schedule for your baby.

# Newborn to 6 weeks

- Sleep is unorganized
- There is nothing a parent can do to manipulate sleep
- Focus on establishing a good feeding schedule

# 6‑8 Weeks

- Many babies start to sleep longer stretches at night (3,4,5 hours)
- Afternoon fussiness starts to begin
- Social smiling begins – a sign that the brain is maturing and sleep is becoming organized

# 2 Months to 3 Months

- Baby begins to be more alert
- Be aware of sleep cues: yawning, fussy, tugging ears, moving head, zoning
- Wakeful periods of about 45‑90 minutes
- Let baby determine length of nap
- 4‑6 naps in the day
- 2 feedings at night

# 3 Months to 4 Months

- Start to establish good day sleep patterns
- Awake time is between 60‑120 minutes
- 3‑5 naps a day, becoming organized around the clock
- Bedtime between 6pm – 8pm
- 2 feedings at night

# 4 Months to 5 Months

- Now is a good time to focus on sleep training
- Short naps should be pushed to 1 hour, try to leave the baby in the crib for a full hour even if they are awake. They may go back to sleep.
- 1 feeding at night
- Bedtime should be no more than 3‑4 hours after the last nap
- If previously bed sharing or using a bassinet, now is a good time to start using a crib for night sleeping.
- Use a consistent place for sleeping, darken room and no movement, no props
- Put baby down awake when possible, promoting self soothing skills

# 6 Months to 8 Months

- Some babies will begin to nap longer and might only need two naps
- 3rd naps, if they exist, might be very short. Try not to let them start past 4pm.
- Bedtime should be about 3.5‑4 hours after the end of the afternoon nap, 5‑7pm bedtime
- 0 night feedings
- Consistent naps and soothing routines work best to help promote a good night time sleep

# 8 Months to 12 Months

- 2 naps
- Afternoon nap becomes the long nap
- Don’t be afraid to put your child down for an early bedtime if they are fussy
- 0 feedings at night

# 13 Months to 18 Months

- Transitioning to 1 nap might be beginning
- Naptime around 11‑12:00pm
- Bedtime no later than 4 hours after last nap

# 27 Months to 3 Years

- Children will begin to transition to no nap, this may take several months
- Bedtime could be anywhere between 5:30 and 8pm depending on if they napped or not
- Night wakings may reoccur until they fully adjust to the transition of no napping.

# Key Points

- Consistency will help your child fall asleep easier
- Transitional times vary for each child
- Over-tired children will wake more often at night
- It isn’t the length of time that is important, it is the quality
- Motionless sleep creates quality sleep
- Sleep begets sleep
