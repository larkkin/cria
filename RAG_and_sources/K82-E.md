# What to Expect in the First Three Months

# Information for New Parents
---
# Congratulations on the birth of your baby.

This handout will provide you with some important information on what to expect in the first three months after your baby is born. The websites and resources in this handout are intended to guide you and your family on what to expect in the first three months of your baby’s life at home. You will find answers to questions you may have regarding healthy newborn care and care of the mother and of the family.

If you have a premature baby, twins, or other special situation, you may need some additional support beyond the information found in this guide. The information in this booklet, including the resources and links, does not replace medical advice from your health care provider. Due to unique individual needs, consult with your health care provider for medical attention and guidance.

Do not hesitate to ask for help if you are worried for any reason about your baby’s health or your health.
